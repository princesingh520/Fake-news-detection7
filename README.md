# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION
# Problem Statement

Build a classification model to detect fake news articles based on textual content. :Apply NLP techniques to real-world problems involving text classification and misinformation detection

# Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to classify news articles as "real" or "fake" using two datasets: fake.csv (containing fake news articles) and true.csv (containing genuine news articles). The solution leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to address the growing challenge of misinformation in digital media.

# Project Structure

The notebook is organized into the following sections:


<u>Libraries:  Importing necessary Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

<u>Loading Dataset:  Loading the datasets containing fake and true news articles.

<u>Data Exploration:  Initial exploration of the datasets to understand their structure and content.

<u>Data Preprocessing:   Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis, including label assignment.

<u>Model Training:   Training machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to classify news articles.

<u>Evaluation:   Assessing model performance using accuracy and classification reports.

# Key Features


Data Loading:   Uses Pandas to load and merge datasets of fake and true news.

Text Preprocessing:   Includes text cleaning and feature extraction using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

Model Comparison:   Evaluates multiple classifiers to determine the best-performing model.

Visualization:   Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.

# Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pandas

seaborn

matplotlib

scikit-learn

wordcloud

re (for text cleaning)



# Dataset

The project uses two datasets:

Fake.csv: Contains fake news articles.

True.csv: Contains true news articles.

Each dataset includes columns such as title, text, subject, and date. A label column is added to distinguish between fake (0) and true (1) news.

# Results

The notebook demonstrates the performance of different machine learning models in classifying news articles. Key metrics such as accuracy and classification reports are provided to compare model effectiveness.
